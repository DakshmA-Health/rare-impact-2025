# 📁 Submissions Directory

> **Note:** This is an instructions file for the submissions folder. Each team should create their own folder and README.md file inside it.

This directory contains all hackathon project submissions. Each team should create their own folder following the naming convention below.

## 📋 Folder Structure

**Simple Structure:** Create ONE folder with your team name. Put ALL your files directly in this folder.

```
submissions/
└── your-team-name/       # Example: "team-innovators" or "rare-disease-trackers"
    ├── README.md         # ⚠️ REQUIRED - Your project documentation (see template below)
    ├── [all your code files]     # Put source code files directly here
    ├── [screenshots/images]      # Put demo materials directly here
    └── [any other files]         # Everything in one place - no subfolders!
```

> 💡 **Keep it simple:** All files (code, docs, images, etc.) go directly in your team folder. No subfolders needed!

## 📝 Your Team's README.md

**Important:** You must create a `README.md` file inside your team folder (`submissions/your-team-name/README.md`) with:
- Team information (names, roles, contacts)
- Problem statement
- Solution overview
- Technical implementation details
- Demo video link
- Setup instructions

📘 See the complete template in [Submission Guidelines](../SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES.md#-readmemd-template)

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Demo Videos**: Include a link to your demo video (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) in YOUR team's README.md. Do NOT commit video files to this repository.

2. **File Size**: Keep screenshots and images reasonable in size. Large files may cause issues.

3. **Code Organization**: Put all your source code files directly in your team folder. No subfolders needed.

4. **Documentation**: Your team's `README.md` should be comprehensive and follow the template provided in the [Submission Guidelines](../SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES.md).

## 🚫 What NOT to Include

- Video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.) - use links instead
- Large binary files
- Environment files (`.env`, config files with secrets)
- Dependencies (`node_modules/`, `venv/`, etc.)
- IDE-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.)

These are automatically ignored by `.gitignore`, but please be mindful.
